# Invoice API Endpoint Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The invoice API endpoints were returning 404 errors due to incorrect routing configuration:
- `POST /api/invoices/` was not accessible
- The endpoints were incorrectly routed to `/api/invoices/invoices/` due to double prefix

## Root Cause
1. In `backend/app/api/invoices.py`, the router was defined with a prefix:
   ```python
   router = APIRouter(prefix="/invoices", tags=["invoices"])
   ```

2. In `backend/app/main.py`, the router was included with only `/api` prefix:
   ```python
   app.include_router(invoices.router, prefix="/api", tags=["Invoices"])
   ```

3. This caused the actual endpoints to be registered at `/api/invoices/invoices/` instead of `/api/invoices/`

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed main.py (Line 230)
Changed from:
```python
app.include_router(invoices.router, prefix="/api", tags=["Invoices"])
```
To:
```python
app.include_router(invoices.router, prefix="/api/invoices", tags=["Invoices"])
```

### 2. Fixed invoices.py (Line 25)
Changed from:
```python
router = APIRouter(prefix="/invoices", tags=["invoices"])
```
To:
```python
router = APIRouter()
```

## Endpoints Now Available

After the fix, the following invoice endpoints are correctly accessible:

- `GET /api/invoices/` - List all invoices
- `GET /api/invoices/{invoice_id}` - Get specific invoice
- `POST /api/invoices/` - Create new invoice
- `PUT /api/invoices/{invoice_id}` - Update invoice
- `DELETE /api/invoices/{invoice_id}` - Delete invoice
- `POST /api/invoices/{invoice_id}/pdf` - Generate PDF for invoice
- `POST /api/invoices/preview-pdf` - Preview PDF without saving
- `POST /api/invoices/{invoice_id}/duplicate` - Duplicate invoice

## Documents Endpoint
The documents endpoint at `GET /api/documents/` was already correctly configured and should be working.

## Testing
A test script has been created at `backend/test_endpoints.py` to verify all endpoints are accessible. Run it with:
```bash
python test_endpoints.py
```

## Next Steps
1. Restart the backend server for changes to take effect
2. Run the test script to verify all endpoints are working
3. Test invoice creation from the frontend to ensure full integration is working
