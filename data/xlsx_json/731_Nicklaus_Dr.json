These include project management to coordinate multiple trades and work sequences, site safety systems and protection measures for occupied spaces, equipment transportation and setup, business insurance coverage, and ongoing quality oversight. Without proper overhead allocation, projects lack adequate supervision, coordination, and safety measures, leading to delays, quality issues, and potential safety hazards.\n\nPROFIT:\nProfit margin is necessary for any sustainable business to provide professional services, assume project risks, and honor warranty commitments. This margin enables contractors to maintain skilled workforces, invest in proper equipment and training, carry adequate insurance coverage, and remain financially stable to complete projects and honor warranties. Companies operating without reasonable profit margins cannot provide reliable service or stand behind their work long-term.\n\nREGULATORY REFERENCES:\n- IRC R503.1: Subfloor requirements and installation standards\n- IRC R702.3: Drywall installation and finishing requirements  \n- OSHA 29 CFR 1926.57: Dust control requirements\n- EPA RRP Rule: Lead-safe work practices and containment\n- Industry Standards: IICRC S500 water damage restoration",
