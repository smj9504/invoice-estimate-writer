Partial tile replacement, as suggested by the carrier, will inevitably result in visible grout line discrepancies, color variations (due to natural aging and wear of existing tile), and texture mismatches. This fails to restore the bathroom to its \"pre-loss condition\" with \"Like Kind and Quality\" materials and finishes, which is a fundamental principle of insurance restoration. IRC R302.1 mandates that repairs shall be of materials and methods equivalent to those used in the original construction.\n\nWaterproofing Integrity (IRC R702.4.3, R702.4.2): When water damage necessitates the removal of any portion of a tiled shower or bathroom wall/floor, the underlying waterproofing membrane (e.g., shower pan liner, liquid applied membrane) is often compromised. Patching a compromised waterproofing system is a high-risk endeavor that can lead to future leaks, structural damage, and mold growth. IRC R702.4.3 requires a waterproof membrane for shower and tub walls, and R702.4.2 mandates a shower pan liner. Replacing the entire tiled area allows for the installation of a complete, continuous, and code-compliant waterproofing system, ensuring long-term integrity and preventing future water intrusion, thereby mitigating future liability for both the homeowner and the insurer.\n\nSubstrate Integrity: Water intrusion often wicks into the cement board or drywall behind the tile, compromising its structural integrity and creating an environment conducive to mold growth. Replacing the entire tiled section ensures all compromised substrate is removed and replaced, which is critical for health, safety, and structural soundness."
