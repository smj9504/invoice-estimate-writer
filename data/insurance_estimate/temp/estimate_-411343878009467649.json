  "top_note": "This estimate provides a detailed breakdown of costs for moving and contents management services following a property event at 723 Old Hunt Way, Herndon, VA. The scope includes comprehensive pack-out and pack-in services for basement contents, secure transportation, two months of climate-controlled storage, specialized handling for unique items, and debris hauling.<br>The estimate explicitly accounts for the <strong>extremely challenging access conditions</strong>, which include a <strong>long walk through a backyard gate, slippery grass, and a slope</strong>. This is further compounded by the need to move <strong>heavy lifting equipment (bar, squat rack)</strong> and <strong>large, heavy furniture (pool table, exercise machines)</strong>. These significant complications necessitate increased labor time, specialized equipment, and enhanced safety protocols, all of which are reflected in the adjusted pricing to ensure an accurate and defensible estimate for review.",
